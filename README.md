# RLC-circuits simulator

Final project for 2304263 Introduction to Computational Physics in semester 2/2020 by Nutthapol Tantisiriwattana, Paramott Bunnjaweht, Tawan Choorod and Theerathep Ngamphakdeekul.

The simulation uses Nodal Analysis to calculate current and voltage over each individual component which are then exported in output files.
